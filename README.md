# MassLinkOpener
This extension aims to open several links at the same time. This can be used to search in them, bookmark them and archive them.

It aims to support both relative and absolute links the user has highlighted and the extension will be activated through the browser's context menu. 

For now only support for Chrome is being worked on although support for Firefox is planned.

i am creating this extension to learn and because no similar extension that i can find seems to be able to open relative links, or detect them reliably.
