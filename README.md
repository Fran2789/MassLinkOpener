# MassLinkOpener
This extension aims to open several links at the same time. This can be used to search in them or archive them using other browser extensions, or open several links at once which can then be bookmarked all at once using browser shortcuts. 

It aims to support both relative and absolute links the user has highlighted and the extension will be activated through the browser's context menu. 

For now only support for Chrome is being worked on although support for Firefox is planned.

i am creating this extension to learn and because no similar extension that i can find seems to be able to open relative links, or detect them reliably.
